    "longDescription": "You step out onto the Porch. It's mostly dry here, since it's covered by the roof, but you still feel the cold rain being blown against your face. The street is obscured by the dark and the storm. You shiver and wrap your arms around yourself. The three big trees in the front yard look alive as they sway in the wind. The bushes along the edge of the house cast dark shadows across the floor with every flash of lightning. The door back to the Family room is to the west. Something has torn a gash in the wood of the door. You have no interest in leaving the porch.",
