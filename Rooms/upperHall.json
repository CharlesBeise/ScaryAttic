You know that you will find the Utility Room to the south, the Bathroom to the west, the Master Bedroom to the southwest, and the Second Bedroom to the northwest. There is an Attic hatch in the ceiling.",

There are three framed pictures on the wall - various photos of a stranger's family. They look… mostly happy.",

The second shows a large group of people standing in front of the house with smiles on their faces, except for a young man near the back with a stern look. The third picture frame has an image of a woman in her 30's or 40's. She is smiling, but the smile isn’t quite reaching her eyes. Despite the fading of the photo, it feels like her gaze is looking straight through you. All three pictures are probably from at least a couple generations ago. One of the paintings is hanging slightly askew."
