It's your first night in the new house. An old 2-story Victorian-style home nestled just outside the city. Most of your belongings are still scattered in boxes around the house. For tonight, it's just you and the mattress on the floor.
Somehow you're both exhausted from the move and unable to sleep. This is your first time seeing the house at night. Built a hundred years ago, the house is full of old wood, metal, and unfamiliar sounds. Rain starts to patter against the bedroom window.
Just as you start to drift off to sleep, you hear a THUMP from downstairs. It was loud, and you can't push it out of your mind. With a sigh, you get up to have a look and turn on the light. Suddenly, a flash fills the room, and you hear the rumbling clap of thunder. The power in the house cuts out. Downstairs, you hear it again... THUMP.
