First, you see a shadow. Then a round, black and white face. A tuxedo cat dashes out from the bushes and hops onto the porch. It is clearly wary of you, but its eyes are locked on the food in the dish behind you. Its fur is ragged, and it looks like it is expecting something from you.
It screams at you - the same, chilling howl that you heard in your bedroom. The cat is hungry, and it is expecting to be fed.
Poor thing must have been left behind. You speak gentle words to the cat and scoot the dish of food closer to it. The cat eagerly devours the food. This is your cat now, you suppose.
The cat's body vibrates with purring as it licks the plate clean. It allows you to reach out a hand and pet its head. At last, you feel your body relax. You look forward to having a friend to keep you company in this drafty house as you start your next adventure.
